# Papers

"Papers" is my space of thoughts or opinions, resources, tutorials and 
articles written in various formats.

The content varies and delves into various topics, fields or thoughts.

## What formats do I use?

### a) HTML pages

Such content usually serves as a resource of links, articles or even codeblocks.

You can view this content in any browser, say `links` or `firefox`

### b) Presentations

This content tries to teach or present a thought using the [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method)
of presentation. It focuses on explaining the problem slide-by-slide.

I use a fork of [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) stored in 
my [bsd-dotfiles](https://github.com/zaklaus/bsd-dotfiles/) repo to display my presentations.

### c) Topics

These are a bit of both, topics usually contain a presentation describing the issue
alongside HTML pages being written to complement with examples, supporting articles
or resource listings.

Topics might contain shell scripts or even programs to support the discussion.

## How to respond back?
