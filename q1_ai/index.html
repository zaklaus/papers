<h1>Quake 1 Monsters</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Quake 1 monsters are quite simple in nature. They make
use of frame-based ticking where they advance in animation
while executing any kind of callback.</p>
<p>Quake 1 defines several AI functions with which the monster feels alive
and is able to find potential targets to hunt.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a monster is to create an animated
model with all the animations you seek to make use of.</p>
<p>Quake 1 uses MDL model format which provides a sequence of frames
we can use to animate the monster.</p>
<p>These frames are then annotated within the QuakeC code like:
<pre><code> $frame attack1 attack2 attack3 attack4 attack5 attack6 attack7 attack8
 $frame death1 death2 death3 death4 death5 death6 death7 death8 death9
 $frame deathb1 deathb2 deathb3 deathb4 deathb5 deathb6 deathb7 deathb8
 $frame deathb9
 $frame pain1 pain2 pain3 pain4 pain5 pain6</code></pre>
</p>
<p>The QuakeC pre-processor converts these to indexes that are used to specify which frame we want to use.</p>
<p>Each monster defines animations states by chaining a sequence of function calls
that have intended side-effect (an action) assigned.</p>
<p>Say we look at the attack state:
<pre><code> void() dog_atta1	=[	$attack1,	dog_atta2	] {ai_charge(10);};
 void() dog_atta2	=[	$attack2,	dog_atta3	] {ai_charge(10);};
 void() dog_atta3	=[	$attack3,	dog_atta4	] {ai_charge(10);};
 void() dog_atta4	=[	$attack4,	dog_atta5	] {
 sound (self, CHAN_VOICE, &quot;dog/dattack1.wav&quot;, 1, ATTN_NORM);
 dog_bite();};
 void() dog_atta5	=[	$attack5,	dog_atta6	] {ai_charge(10);};
 void() dog_atta6	=[	$attack6,	dog_atta7	] {ai_charge(10);};
 void() dog_atta7	=[	$attack7,	dog_atta8	] {ai_charge(10);};
 void() dog_atta8	=[	$attack8,	dog_run1	] {ai_charge(10);};</code></pre>
</p>
<p>As you can see, each animation is represented by a chain of calls.</p>
<p>Method <code>dog_atta4</code> also emits a sound while performing an attack on the target.</p>
<h2>How does Quake decide on when to run, walk or attack?</h2>
<p>When we set up our monster, we fill out the monster info like:
<pre><code> self.th_stand = dog_stand1;
 self.th_walk = dog_walk1;
 self.th_run = dog_run1;
 self.th_pain = dog_pain;
 self.th_die = dog_die;
 self.th_melee = dog_atta1;
 self.th_missile = dog_leap1;</code></pre>
</p>
<p>When the <code>ai_*</code> AI methods are executed by the frame methods, they perform checks
on a possible target and switch states internally.</p>
<p>As a modder, if using the base game mode code, you can easily hack
these methods to alter the AI. You can look at methods such as:
<pre><code> * FoundTarget
 * ai_run
 * HuntTarget</code></pre>
</p>
<p>and alter how monsters perceive the enemy.</p>
<h2>This is how the monster's FSM generally looks like</h2>
<p>This is a specific instance of the dog monster AI.</p>
